Excellent! The n8n container can successfully communicate with your local Ollama instance. Now let's access the web interfaces:

🎉 Setup Complete! 

Your local AI setup is now running successfully! Here are the access URLs for all your services:

Main Services:
•  🧠 N8N (AI Workflow Builder): http://localhost:8001
•  💬 Open WebUI (ChatGPT-like Interface): http://localhost:8002  
•  🌊 Flowise (Low-code AI Agent Builder): http://localhost:8003
•  🗃️ Supabase Dashboard: http://localhost:8005
•  🔍 SearXNG (Private Search Engine): http://localhost:8006
•  📊 Langfuse (LLM Observability): http://localhost:8007
•  🔗 Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:8008

Next Steps:

1. Access N8N: Go to http://localhost:8001 and create your first account (this is local only)
2. Configure N8N for Local Ollama: 
•  Go to Settings → Credentials 
•  Create a new "Ollama" credential
•  Set the base URL to: http://host.docker.internal:11434
3. Access Open WebUI: Go to http://localhost:8002 and:
•  Create a local account
•  The interface should automatically detect your local Ollama models
•  You can chat with llama3.2:3b or deepseek-r1:8b
4. Integrate N8N with Open WebUI:
•  Download the n8n_pipe.py function and add it to Open WebUI
•  This will allow you to use N8N workflows directly from the chat interface

Your Local Ollama Status:
✅ Running on AMD RX 9070 XT  
✅ Available Models: deepseek-r1:8b, llama3.2:3b
